// using const
const piConstant = 3.14;
// they are used to define values that does not change once defined
// redeclaration and reassigning of value is not allowed in constant

// using var
var someVarValue = 10;
// var is variable that used used to store changing values
// unlike const they can be redeclare and reassigned value

// using let
let someLetValue = 10;
// let is also a variable that used used to store changing values
// although its similar to var but it behaves differently as it can be reassigned value but can't redeclare the values with same variableName


// with no keyword used
someValue = 456;
// when you don't give any keyword while declaring the variable the var properties and behavior is observed


/* Note
 - While declaring a constant value use const
 - while declaring a variable use let instead of var as var have block and functional scoping issues, creating more issues in code
-
