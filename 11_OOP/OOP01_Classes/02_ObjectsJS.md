### 1. What Are Objects in JavaScript?

- In JavaScript, objects are fundamental data structures that store collections of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any data type, including other objects, functions, or primitives. 
- They are versatile and central to JavaScript’s functionality, used to represent complex data and behaviours. 
- Objects are used to model real-world entities or abstract concepts, grouping related data and functionality together. Unlike classes, which provide a structured template, objects can be created directly and modified dynamically.

### 2. Creating Objects

-Objects can be created in several ways, distinct from class-based instantiation:

#### Object Literal Notation
- The most common way to create an object is using curly braces `{}`.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}!`;
  }
};

console.log(person.name); // Output: Alice
console.log(person.greet()); // Output: Hello, I'm Alice!
```

- Properties are defined using key-value pairs. Functions assigned to properties are called methods.

#### Using the `Object` Constructor
- Objects can be created using the `Object` constructor.

```javascript
const car = new Object();
// creating new  props with values
car.brand = "Toyota";
car.model = "Camry";

// Replacing exitsting values as they are already defined
car.brand = "Ford";
car.model = "Mustang";

car.drive = function() {
  return `${this.brand} ${this.model} is driving.`;
};

console.log(car.drive()); // Output: Toyota Camry is driving.
```

- Less common than object literals but useful for explicit object creation.

#### Using `Object.create`
This method creates an object with a specified prototype.

```javascript
const vehicleProto = {
  drive: function() {
    return `${this.name} is driving.`;
  }
};

const car = Object.create(vehicleProto);
car.name = "Honda";

console.log(car.drive()); // Output: Honda is driving.
```

- `Object.create` allows you to set the prototype explicitly, enabling prototypal inheritance without classes means the newly created object has all the props of its prototype.

### 3. Properties and Property Descriptors

Objects have properties that can be manipulated dynamically. Each property has attributes defined by a **property descriptor**, which includes:

- **Value**: The property’s value (e.g., a string, number, or function).
- **Writable**: Whether the value can be changed (`true` or `false`).
- **Enumerable**: Whether the property appears in loops like `for...in` (`true` or `false`).
- **Configurable**: Whether the property can be deleted or modified (`true` or `false`).

You can define or modify properties using `Object.defineProperty` or `Object.defineProperties`.

```javascript
const obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, "id", {
  value: 42,
  writable: false,
  enumerable: true,
  configurable: false
});

console.log(obj.id); // Output: 42
obj.id = 100; // No effect (writable: false)
console.log(obj.id); // Output: 42
```

- Property descriptors provide fine-grained control over how properties behave, useful for creating read-only properties or preventing deletion.

### 4. Accessing and Modifying Properties

Properties can be accessed or modified using dot notation (`obj.name`) or bracket notation (`obj["name"]`).

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "Bob",
  "user-id": 123 // Keys with special characters require bracket notation
};

console.log(user.name); // Output: Bob
console.log(user["user-id"]); // Output: 123

user.name = "Charlie"; // Modify property
user.age = 25; // Add new property
delete user["user-id"]; // Delete property

console.log(user); // Output: { name: "Charlie", age: 25 }
```
  - Bracket notation is required for keys with spaces, hyphens, or dynamic names.
  - Objects are mutable; properties can be added or removed at any time.

### 5. Prototypes and Inheritance

Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which is another object from which it inherits properties and methods. The prototype is accessible via the `__proto__` property (though direct use is discouraged) or `Object.getPrototypeOf`.

```javascript
const parent = {
  sayHello: function() {
    return "Hello from parent!";
  }
};

const child = Object.create(parent);
child.name = "Child";

console.log(child.sayHello()); // Output: Hello from parent!
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(child) === parent); // Output: true
```

- **Key Points**:
  - Prototypes enable inheritance without classes.
  - The prototype chain is traversed when accessing a property that doesn’t exist on the object itself.
  - Use `Object.setPrototypeOf` cautiously, as it can impact performance.

### 6. Object Methods

The `Object` constructor provides utility methods for working with objects:

- **`Object.keys(obj)`**: Returns an array of enumerable property names.
- **`Object.values(obj)`**: Returns an array of enumerable property values.
- **`Object.entries(obj)`**: Returns an array of key-value pairs.
- **`Object.assign(target, ...sources)`**: Copies properties from source objects to the target.
- **`Object.freeze(obj)`**: Prevents modifications to an object.
- **`Object.seal(obj)`**: Prevents adding or deleting properties but allows modifying existing ones.

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // Output: ["a", "b", "c"]
console.log(Object.values(obj)); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
console.log(Object.entries(obj)); // Output: [["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]

const copy = Object.assign({}, obj, { d: 4 });
console.log(copy); // Output: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }

Object.freeze(obj);
obj.a = 100; // No effect
console.log(obj.a); // Output: 1
```

- These methods are essential for manipulating objects and controlling their mutability.

### 7. Objects as Key-Value Stores

Objects are often used as key-value stores, similar to dictionaries or maps in other languages. However, for complex key types (e.g., objects as keys), `Map` is preferred.

```javascript
const scores = {
  Alice: 95,
  Bob: 88
};

scores.Charlie = 92; // Add new entry
console.log(scores); // Output: { Alice: 95, Bob: 88, Charlie: 92 }
```

- Object keys are coerced to strings, so `Map` is better for non-string keys.

### 8. Iterating Over Objects

You can iterate over object properties using `for...in` or `Object` methods.

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

// Using for...in
for (let key in obj) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${obj[key]}`); // Output: a: 1, b: 2, c: 3
}

// Using Object.entries
Object.entries(obj).forEach(([key, value]) => {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // Output: a: 1, b: 2, c: 3
});
```

- `for...in` iterates over enumerable properties, including inherited ones. Use `Object.has Numero de páginas: 6hasOwnProperty` to filter out inherited properties.

### 9. Objects vs. Maps

While objects are often used as key-value stores, `Map` objects (introduced in ES6) are designed specifically for this purpose and offer advantages:

- **Maps support non-string keys**: Objects coerce keys to strings, while Maps do not.
- **Maps are optimized for key-value operations**: Adding, removing, and retrieving items is more straightforward.
- **Maps maintain insertion order**: Objects do not guarantee property order (though modern JavaScript engines preserve it).

```javascript
const map = new Map();
map.set("name", "Alice");
map.set(42, "number");

console.log(map.get(42)); // Output: number
```

- Use `Map` for complex key types or when order matters; use objects for simple, string-keyed data.

### 10. Common Use Cases

- **Data Storage**: Objects store structured data (e.g., user profiles, configurations).
- **Prototypal Inheritance**: Objects serve as prototypes for other objects.
- **Function Containers**: Objects group related functions (e.g., utility modules).
- **JSON Data**: Objects are the native format for JSON, widely used in APIs.

### 11. Limitations and Nuances

- **Key Coercion**: Non-string keys are converted to strings, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
  ```javascript
  const obj = {};
  obj[123] = "number";
  console.log(obj["123"]); // Output: number
  ```
- **Property Order**: While modern JavaScript preserves property order, it’s not guaranteed in older environments.
- **No True Privacy**: Objects lack native private properties (unlike class private fields with `#`).
- **Performance**: Large objects with many properties can be slower than specialized data structures like `Map` or `Set`.

### 12. Best Practices

- **Use Meaningful Keys**: Choose clear, descriptive property names.
- **Avoid Prototype Pollution**: Be cautious when adding properties to `Object.prototype`, as it affects all objects.
- **Use `Map` for Complex Keys**: Prefer `Map` when keys are not strings or when order matters.
- **Freeze or Seal Objects**: Use `Object.freeze` or `Object.seal` to prevent unintended changes in critical objects.
- **Destructure for Clarity**: Use object destructuring to simplify access to properties.
  ```javascript
  const { name, age } = person;
  console.log(name, age); // Output: Alice 30
  ```

### 13. Example: Practical Object Usage

```javascript
const settings = {
  theme: "dark",
  notifications: true,
  update: function(newSettings) {
    Object.assign(this, newSettings);
  }
};

settings.update({ theme: "light", fontSize: 16 });
console.log(settings); // Output: { theme: "light", notifications: true, fontSize: 16 }
```

- **Explanation**: The `settings` object stores configuration data and includes a method to update itself, demonstrating dynamic property management.

### 14. Conclusion

JavaScript objects are versatile, dynamic data structures for storing and manipulating key-value pairs. They support a wide range of use cases, from simple data storage to prototypal inheritance, and are integral to JavaScript programming. While classes provide a structured approach to object creation, direct object manipulation offers flexibility and simplicity for many scenarios. Understanding objects’ properties, prototypes, and utility methods enables developers to write efficient and maintainable code. For advanced key-value operations, consider `Map` as an alternative.
