# API Request and V8 Engine

## API

API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allow two software programs to communicate with each other. This rules describe 1. What you can ask for (the inputs) 2. How you must ask (the rules/format) 3. What youâ€™ll get back (the output/response)

An API lists available operations (like fetch data, save data, send messages) used to interact with software, databases, or devices without needing to know the internal details

Example:

- When you enter `https://api.github.com/users/meghsham-supersolid` in browser, you will get all the information releted with username `meghsham-supersolid` in JSON format

    ```json
